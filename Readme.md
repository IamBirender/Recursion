# Tutorial 1
1. make input smaller
    we take some decision which makes the input smaller as a consequence. So the focus should be on taking the decision rather than making the input small
2. Recursion - Decision tree
    we would be provided some set of choices and a decision space. To solve these problem recursion is a good way.
3. Recursive Tree - Soul of Recursion
    Once we have decided the recursive tree --> writing the code will be a cake walk.
4. 2 steps to solve any recursion problem
    Write the recursive tree and write the code.
